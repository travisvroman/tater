# Tater
A potato blog. Written by a potato.

This was a quick exercise I did in a weekend to learn Angular and MongoDB (I had never used either before). 
It isn't fancy and in fact does not have a login system, but should serve as an example how an application 
like this could be built on both the client and server sides.

## Tater Server
The server-side of the application. Runs on node and currently supports MongoDB. Uses Express. Extensible so another 
database backend could be plugged in.

## Tater Client
The Angular-based client side of the application.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
